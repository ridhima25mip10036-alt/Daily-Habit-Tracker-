# HabiMate – Your Personalized Daily Habit Tracker

# Overview of the Project

In today’s fast-paced world, maintaining daily habits consistently can be challenging. HabitMate is a Python-based application designed to make this task easier and more structured. This project allows users to add, monitor, and track daily habits, helping them achieve their personal goals and develop positive routines over time.

With HabitMate, users can:

* Keep a record of habits they want to follow daily.

* Track whether each habit was completed or not.

* Save progress so it can be viewed and updated later.


This project is especially suitable for students and beginners in programming, as it introduces basic concepts such as user input, file handling, and data management in Python. HabitMate is lightweight, easy to use, and provides a simple interface that ensures users can focus on building their habits rather than navigating a complex system.

# Motivation

The motivation behind creating HabitMate is to encourage self-discipline and personal growth. By visually tracking habits, users can stay motivated and identify patterns in their behavior. Daily habit tracking has been proven to improve productivity, mental well-being, and consistency in achieving personal goals.

# Features

* Mark Habits as Done or Not Done: Track daily progress by marking habits that are completed.

* View Habit Status: See which habits have been completed, which are pending, and analyze progress over time.

* Persistent Data Storage: All habits and their statuses are stored in a CSV or text file, ensuring that data is saved even after closing the program.

* Simple, User-Friendly Interface: Text-based menus make it easy to navigate, even for beginners.

* Flexible and Scalable: New features like habit reminders or streak tracking can be easily added in future updates.


# Technologies / Tools Used

* Programming Language: Python 3.x

* Libraries:

   csv for reading and writing habit data to files

   Built-in Python functions for handling input/output


* Development Environment: Any Python IDE or text editor, including PyCharm, VS Code, or terminal-based execution.


# Steps to Install & Run the Project

1. Ensure that Python 3.x is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.


2. Download or clone the project repository to your local machine.


3. Open the project folder in your preferred IDE or terminal.

python habit_tracker.py


5. Follow the on-screen menu to add new habits, mark them as done, or view your progress.



# Instructions for Testing

1. Open the program using Python.


2. Add a few test habits (e.g., “Exercise,” “Read a book,” “Meditation”).


3. Mark some habits as completed and leave others pending.


4. Save your progress.


5. Close and reopen the program to check that saved habits and their status are loaded correctly.


6. Repeat with different combinations to ensure all features work properly.
